# version 4

**Legend:** ‚úÖ = Completed‚Äã \| ‚è≥= Work In Progress‚Äã \|‚ùì= Unknown Stage‚Äã‚Äã

## ‚è≥ Remove support for _Aurora Services_

There will no longer be support for _Aurora Services_. The reason for this is because there is no point for the continuation of its existence, since the installation method is replaced by _Aurora Store_:‚Äã

1. Install _Aurora Store_ as a **system app**. This has the same effect as if you were to install _Aurora Services_ as a system application. This method does not require root but you will need an unlocked bootloader with a custom recovery like TWRP installed. This installation method is called "Session".‚Äã
2. Install _Aurora Store_ as a **user app**. If you have root access you can give Aurora Store the permissions for "Root" installation method. There is no point to use _Aurora Services_ with root since you can give _Aurora Store_ root permissions already.‚Äã
3. If you have no root access available, the default installation method will be "Native".‚Äã

## ‚è≥ New UI

New UI for a new version üò∏

## **‚ùì Spoofing to be removed from Aurora Store and separate solution for spoofing**

\[Info has been closed for now.\]‚Äã

## ‚è≥ Major Token Dispenser API changes and exclusive use for _Aurora Store_ only!‚Äã

We have seen major issues while observing the main server, and it seems like it has been overloaded with high CPU usages during version 3 recently. Thus, the developer has been trying to counter this with a solution.‚Äã

After this build has been released, the way token dispensers work will be much different than it is now, which is to help reduce the workload of the main server. The main dispenser server will also now be available for _Aurora Store_ only. This should help lower the chances of server downsides and faster loading times.‚Äã
