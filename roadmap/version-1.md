Aurora Store was formerly called the Galaxy Store \(not to be mixed up with Samsung's Galaxy Store!\). It was a fork of Yeriomin's YalpStore which included more features than YalpStore itself. These included:

### ✅ Device spoofing

Pretend to be a different device! With device spoofing you can unlock apps which are only available to certain devices e.g. Pixel Launcher for Pixel.

### ✅ Google & Anonymous sign-in

Anonymous sign-ins let you download and install apps from the Google Play Store without having to own a Google account. Google sign-ins let you download your paid apps.

### **✅ Delta updates**

Delta updates only downloads changes during updates while normal updates will download the whole .apk file.
