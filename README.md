## **Why create Aurora Store?**

Long story short: Because Google's Play store disappoints with a lack of features; Play Store is also proven to be [spyware/malicious](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-google.html). Unfortunately, we cannot always get by with just FOSS apps, so _Aurora Store_ gives us the possibilty to retrieve apps from the Google Play repository without having to trouble you and your device with Google Apps.

If you're a newcomer or have any questions, please read Troubleshooting & FAQs before issuing problems on GitLab or asking for help in the Telegram support chat.
